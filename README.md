## <div id="header1.2" onclick="window.location.hash='Q2'; ">2. Screenshots of Use

The table below details a general walkthrough from start to finish using the program

| Description  | Images |
| :--- | :---: |
| This is the screen when the program is first started, all the elements are shown on screen. There are a couple of elements* Elapsed time- Tells how much time has passed * Totals: Tell how much a certain value superseded a category| <img src="https://github.com/DanielFeissle/Timeantor4200/blob/master/Startup%20Screen.PNG" width="900" height="200">|
| The shows where the user can input values to get diffrent calcualations based on rate  | <img src="https://github.com/DanielFeissle/Timeantor4200/blob/master/ValueInput.PNG" width="900" height="200">|

## <div id="header1.3" onclick="window.location.hash='Q3'; "> 3. Detailed Descriptions
This program allows a user to keep track of how many hours they have worked and watch and see how much they earn.
<br>
It is broken down into six catagories:
* Secound
* Half Minute
* Minute
* 15 Minutes
* Half Hour
* Hour

How the tally system works is that once the value reaches one of the catagories the tally will up tick one and so will the total columns. The total columns will only update when the criteria for that catagory has been meet
For instance, if there has been three minute tallies then it means it has just recently been updated three times.
<br>

Lastly, there are two options for speed in the application: Normal and Fast.
<br>
* Normal speed is recommended as it uses real time and is a fairly accurate representation of the values displayed on screen
* Fast speed is recommended only for debugging purposes only to ensure that values are calcualted correctly
